        <h3>Who is this course for?</h3>
        <p>
          CBT is recognised by the National Health Service as a major
          psychological treatment modality, with a substantial and growing
          evidence base. The Postgraduate Certificate will appeal to a wide
          range of healthcare professionals. The course has attracted students
          from clinical and counselling psychology, psychiatry, general
          practice, nursing, social work, speech therapy, occupational therapy,
          counselling and the voluntary sector.
        </p>
        <h3>Course aims</h3>
        <p>
          The Course aims to provide students with: 1. A sound knowledge of
          cognitive behavioural models, concepts and methods. 2. An
          understanding of issues of importance relating to the theory and
          practice of CBT. These include: the relationship between CBT theory
          and therapy the use of CBT with a variety of client groups and
          disorders related research on outcome and process 3. Competence in
          assessing patient suitability for CBT in developing CBT
          case-formulations in devising and implementing individual treatment
          programmes in evaluating their effects 4. The ability to convey
          clearly the central concepts of CBT and to communicate basic treatment
          skills. The Course does not aim to prepare students to teach and
          supervise CBT. The emphasis is on acquiring, practising and
          communicating specialised clinical skills, within an explicit
          theoretical framework in relation to associated empirical research.
        </p>
        <h3>Course content and structure</h3>
        <p>
          The course begins with an induction teaching block followed by one
          full day per week over two terms. In teaching sessions, emphasis is
          placed on observation of CBT in action and on experiential learning
          with participation in role-play and other practical exercises.
          Students receive two hours of small group supervision weekly. Reading
          and completion of written assignments will be undertaken in addition
          to the teaching days. Many students find it effective to set aside six
          to seven hours a week for private study. Students will be expected to
          have access to treatment settings with regular clinical and CBT
          supervision where cognitive behavioural therapy skills can be
          practised and refined on a regular basis throughout the course. Part
          I: Basic concepts and skills These sessions provide a theoretical and
          empirical basis for the practice of CBT. There is a strong emphasis on
          observation of CBT in action and on experiential learning with
          participation in role-play and other practical exercises. Topics
          include: Beck’s cognitive model of emotional disorder CBT assessment
          and formulation The structure of CBT (agenda setting, goal setting,
          pacing, homework etc.) The style of CBT (collaboration, explicitness,
          feedback) Socratic methods Identifying and re-evaluating automatic
          thoughts Identifying and re-evaluating rules and assumptions The role
          of behavioural experiments Process and ending therapy issues in CBT
          Part II: Special applications - developing the basics This part of the
          course covers the use of CBT with common mental health problems
          (anxiety disorders and depression,). Sessions focus on consolidating
          and developing basic knowledge and skills and on emphasising concepts
          and methods especially relevant to each problem area. Teaching
          practical CBT skills is grounded in current and emerging evidence base
          derived from related empirical research. Workshops focus on problem
          areas such as: Depression and suicidality Simple phobias Panic
          disorder and agoraphobia Social anxiety disorder Health anxiety
          Obsessive compulsive disorder An introduction to trauma Assessment
          Students are required to: take an active part in teaching and
          supervision sessions by attending all teaching sessions and actively
          participating in live practice complete a course of CBT with a minimum
          of three patients complete a case presentation in term one complete a
          case report of one treated case in term two submit audio/video
          recordings of CBT sessions for formative and summative assessment in
