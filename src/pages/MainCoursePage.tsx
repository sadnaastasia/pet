          Theory and Practice of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: a clinical course
          with pre-accreditation status
        </h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The Theory and Practice of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: a clinical
          course with pre-accreditation status is a course for qualified
          healthcare professionals, providing high-quality training and
          supervision in CBT theory and practice. The course draws on an
          impressive body of local specialist skill and knowledge. During the
          course students are expected to practise and develop their CBT skills
          within a treatment setting, and to complete written case reports and
          clinical recordings for assessment. After successful completion
          students are awarded a Postgraduate Certificate. This award can
          contribute towards a Postgraduate Diploma in CBT, accredited by The
          British Association of Behavioural & Cognitive Psychotherapies at
          Level 1.

        <p>
          CBT is recognised by the National Health Service as a major
          psychological treatment modality, with a substantial and growing
          evidence base. The Postgraduate Certificate will appeal to a wide
          range of healthcare professionals. The course has attracted students
          from clinical and counselling psychology, psychiatry, general
          practice, nursing, social work, speech therapy, occupational therapy,
          counselling and the voluntary sector.

            The Course aims to provide students with:
            <li>
              A sound knowledge of cognitive behavioural models, concepts and
              methods.{' '}

                An understanding of issues of importance relating to the theory

                <li>

          <br /> The Course does not aim to prepare students to teach and
          supervise CBT. The emphasis is on acquiring, practising and
          communicating specialised clinical skills, within an explicit
          theoretical framework in relation to associated empirical research.

          <p>
            The course begins with an induction teaching block followed by one
            full day per week over two terms. In teaching sessions, emphasis is
            placed on observation of CBT in action and on experiential learning
            with participation in role-play and other practical exercises.
            Students receive two hours of small group supervision weekly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reading and completion of written assignments will be undertaken in
            addition to the teaching days. Many students find it effective to
            set aside six to seven hours a week for private study.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Students will be expected to have access to treatment settings with
            regular clinical and CBT supervision where cognitive behavioural
            therapy skills can be practised and refined on a regular basis
            throughout the course.
          </p>{' '}
          <b>Part I: Basic concepts and skills</b> <br /> These sessions provide
          a theoretical and empirical basis for the practice of CBT. There is a
          strong emphasis on observation of CBT in action and on experiential
          learning with participation in role-play and other practical
          exercises.
